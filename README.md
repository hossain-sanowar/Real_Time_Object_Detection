# Real-Time-Object-Detection
This project can detect different types of objects in real-time. For the frontend part, I have used React. It captures real-time images using a webcam and then detects objects using TensorFlow JS libraries.

How it works:
1. Use React.JS for the frontend
2. Capture images using a webcam
3. Detect objects using Tensorflow JS
